!This is where all of the PGI CUDA FORTRAN code will go, and these routines will be called from prim_advection_mod.
!This is compiled regardless, but PGI-specific calls are always wrapped in the USE_CUDA_FORTRAN ifdefs that are automagically
!activated when -Mcuda is specified during compilation with a PGI compiler. Thus, it will be ignored unless explicitly
!activated by the user
!
!As a general rule, all of the routines in here will be called within a threaded context (assuming ELEMENT_OPENMP is not
!deifned), and therefore, we enforce BARRIERS, MASTERS, and SINGLES from within these routines rather than outside them.
!This is to minimize the visible code impacts on the existing CPU code.

! Please pay attention to this all caps passive aggresive banner.
